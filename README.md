# Decoder_DeepONet
A hybrid  Decoder-DeepONet operator regression framework for unaligned observation data.
  
All the codes are developed on basis of DEEPXDE(https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/cite_deepxde.html).

Before you run the codes of different models, the net module file in DEEPXDE should be replaced by 'module.py'.
